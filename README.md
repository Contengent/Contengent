I'm a "dev" that is really into trying to find something to code. I'm not at all good with design and I'm still less then a novice. I don't really enjoy coding websites so if I ever make one that looks even a little pretty, with js or some framework, my host body has been taken over by a being that is not myself. I really enjoy these cute little things called "not java," and "not C#," I'm okay to code with them, but I'm just gonna complain the whole time.

 <summary><h3> ðŸ§®Contengent's Programming History </h3></summary>
  I started with minecraft and coding some cheats and stuff, because I wasn't very good and I wanted to play factions. I then moved on to doing school work (crazy I know), which kinda stopped my coding <b>progress</b> (I was doing stuff, it was just really stupid or simple) except for when people would like, ask me if I could code them a website, and I just hated saying no so I learned even if I say "llol I'm not coding u a website broski". Then eventually highschool hit and I got really stressed with all my courses and stuff so I started coding a lot more, and learning a whole bunch of stuff.

   Now I'm focused on actually writing software that I can post to my github. I Mainly code stuff that I have a deep interest in, such as: Proof of concept malware, malware/exploit reasearch, and undetectable game cheats will mostly be posted here. I don't really plan on making anything related to game development anymore, since I've decided that it is highly uninteresting to me, and that I do not have the artistic skillset (drawing, making music, etc.) to do so.
